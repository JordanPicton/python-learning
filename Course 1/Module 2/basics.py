# The example above has a String inside which is a data type.

#Below is an example of the function print, that's it's function name. It needs two parenthesis one opening and one closing respectively.
#With the one below it doesn't have an argument but still needs those parenthesis to show it's a function name. In this case it would print an empty line. Similar to a line break in HTML.
